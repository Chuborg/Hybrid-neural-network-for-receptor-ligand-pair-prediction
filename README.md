# Hybrid-neural-network-for-receptor-ligand-pair-prediction
Takes two inputs: 1 - distance matrix with receptor info, 2 - distance matrix with ligand info, outputs 2 classes: pair can interact/pair cannot interact.

Data (receptors, ligands, annotations) were taken from BioLip (Ligand-protein database, https://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/BioLiP/download.html).
